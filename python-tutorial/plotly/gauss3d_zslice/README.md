====
take z slices out of volumetric data

step 1: Analytic function
----
Given analytic function of scalar field, taking slices is easy
zslice_gauss3d.py

step 2: Samples of scalar field
----
Visualize samples on a regular grid (too dense to see anything)
scatter_gauss3d.py

step 3: Sample slices
----
extract regular grid dimensions from samples, then directly construct slices
scatter_gauss3d.py
